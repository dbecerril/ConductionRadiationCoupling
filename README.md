Solves the hyperbolic thermal transport equation in a 1-D slab coupled to the near-field radiative heat transfer from a neighboring slab.  
In this work we describe the thermalization dynamics and temperature distributions in bodies
composed of hyperbolic materials exchanging energy via near-field thermal radiation. As opposed
to Fourier materials Non-Fourier hyperbolic materials do not suppose an instant response between
the temperature gradiend and heat flux. This time delay can alter the temperature distribution
inside the bodies and slow down the thermalization dynamic. Our results can have important
repercusions and applications in hyperthermia photothermal cancer treatment, since it has been
shown that hyperbolic equations better describe the energy transfer in this type of medium.
